        <p>The tricky part is figuring out what doesn’t belong in the project description. The description should 
        focus on goals, objectives, and the overall approach, but you don’t need to include lists of tasks, an 
        extensive background, or research analysis. In general, the project description is broad; you’ll includ
        e more detail in the project plan.The project manager often writes the project description. However, if

        to learn how to write a project description in a project proposal.A project description is a
        high-level overview of why you’re doing a project. The document explains a project’s objectives

        without delving into how.
